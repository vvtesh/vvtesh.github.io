<b>The Art and Science Behind Search Engines:</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp;Can you imagine a life without search engines? It might not be an exaggeration even to claim that our ability to access the right information at the right time is crucial for our success. In the post-COVID era of digital dominance, we are expected to be inundated with data. Availability of big data has necessitated a systematic study of data storage and retrieval techniques. Principles and practices of information retrieval have been a focus of both researchers and practitioners alike. The field of study that deals with search and search engines is popularly known as "Information Retrieval". This session introduces "Information Retrieval". It touches upon two major questions: 1) What is the science behind search engines? In other words, how do these search engines work? and 2) What career (both industrial and research) opportunities exist for search enthusiasts?<i>NPTEL - Live Sessions - Special Lecture Series, 26th Jun, 2020.</i><a href=teaching/talks/NPTEL-IR.pdf>Slides</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmcgyDLL2CY">Video</a></font>

<b>Code Variants Retrieval:</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp; Code variants represent alternative implementations of a code snippet, where each alternative provides the same functionality, but has different properties that make some of them better suited to the overall project requirements. Developers routinely need to analyze existing code, find better reuse alternatives, and look to develop high-quality code that meets some desired properties. However, searching for such code variants over the web has several challenges. Existing text-retrieval models do not work well on source code. Expressing natural language queries on source code is an open problem. Many query terms in natural language have multiple surface forms in source code. We address this problem by perceiving source code as a collection of entities. In this talk, we present new techniques to search for code variants. The ability to perform semantic search over source code snippets assisted by developer knowledge in the form of discussion forum data opens up a new way to solve several important problems.<i>3rd International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science, Chennai, India, 21st Feb, 2020.</i></font>

<b>Demystifying Datascience:</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp; This talk is split into two parts. In the first part, I address two key questions, "What is data science?" and "Why study data science?". As an example of science behind the data, in the second part of this talk, I take search as an example to show how seeing data in a new way can get you great benefits. &nbsp;<i>SSN Institutions, 14th Dec, 2019.</i><a href=teaching/talks/SSN-DemystifyingDS.pdf>Slides</a></font>

<b>Graphs in Program Analysis:</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp;Software has become ubiquitous. Understanding and reasoning about program properties have become necessary. In this talk, I introduce program analysis using one example from the classic four data flow analyses. Specifically, the talk will focus on the role of graphs in program analysis. Towards the end, we discuss some research trends and potential open problems for future research.

<b>The Magic of Models (With Two Case Studies):</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp;The journey from complex problems to beautiful solutions often requires us to take a stop at a station called models! Abstracting out unnecessary details helps us to focus on the core of the problem and therefore to find elegant solutions. In this talk, I discuss few interesting models from diverse areas including 1) the application of vectors to model a real world problem that often occurs wherever we need to compare natural language (say English) sentences, and 2) the application of our knowledge on forms and functions on bayesian data analysis.

<b>Big Data - Text Processing: Principles and Practices:</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp;Text Processing is essential for several applications. Our primary medium of communication over the web remains to be text. In this talk, I explain the need  for data structures using the example of suffix trees. In the second part of the talk, I show how vector space models have been used in search engines. With these two examples, we gather a glimpse of principles and practices of dealing with big textual data.&nbsp;<i>SSN Analytica, SSN Institutions, Chennai, 11th May, 2019.</i><a href=SSNAnlaytica-LiveSession.pdf>Slides</a></font>

<b>Information Retrieval: An Overview:</b>&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">&nbsp;This talk starts with the notion and role of "information" in daily life. I will then discuss the library and information sciences practices that led to the field of digital libraries and further to search engines. I introduce Information Retrieval (IR)
covering basics of indexing and query processing. As part of the indexing step, I discuss vector space model to represent text, further leading to postings list. As part of query processing, I discuss simple 
boolean queries (AND, OR, NOT) answered by merging the postings. We end the talk with a note on comparing and evaluating IR systems. <i>Post-IOI (International Olympiad for Informatics) Training Camp Workshop, Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), 9th May, 2019.</i><a href=PostIOITCWorkshopCMI-IR.pdf>Slides</a></font>

<b>Code Variants and Their Retrieval</b>:&nbsp;<font size=2 face="verdana">Information plays a crucial role in our day to day life. In this talk, I  introduce you to the principles and practices behind information retrieval  using  a  case  of  code  variants  search.  Developers routinely  analyze existing code, find better reuse  alternatives,  and  look  to  develop  high-quality  code.  Our research shows that 25% to 40% of developer discussions in bug reports are about variants. However, searching for such code variants over the web  has several  challenges.  Using knowledge  driven approaches,  we propose a system to automate the search for code variants.&nbsp;<i>Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI), 9th January, 2019.</i></font>
