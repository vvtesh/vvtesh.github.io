<!-- Information retrieval happens over several content types with text being the most prominent type. We focus on source code retrieval. Source code retrieval is interesting for several reasons. Firstly, classic program analysis has limitations from scalability perspective. Moreover, working on non-compilable snippets is also a challenge. Secondly, search features for code in IDE is not as advanced as it is for text. Development environments such as Eclipse and NetBeans still use a simple keyword or regex based matching. There is also support for structural querying such as querying for method hierarchy. Yet, comparing against the cool things google could do with text queries, there is a long way to go with source code. Thirdly, many software engineering problems can be modeled as problem over search leveraging the big data we have. -->

<section id=reco><font size=4 face="verdana"><strong>My Recommendations</strong></font></section>
<font face="verdana" size=2>Here are a list of books I really enjoyed reading:</font>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/3770CL5>How Life Imitates Chess</a>: Although there is no game without a king, the most powerful piece on the board is the queen, and her job is to protect the king. In life too, you might be the most important person. But, unless the most powerful protects you, you might not exist. Moreover, if you are strong enough, protect the weak. This book comes with many such comparisons between life and chess. I found a purpose of living after reading this book. Am sure this book will remain in my top 10 list forever.</li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/39cMsKs>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</a>: Only when you are deep into some activity, do you really start seeing the true beauty. The importance of deep work is being explained by no other than an MIT PhD! A great read. The second half on social media is a little overstretched, I feel. Hence, this book misses the top spot.</li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2QIB1D9>The Elements of Style</a>: This should be in the private library of every student. I have a detailed <a href=blogs/writing/index.html>blog</a> on why you should read this book.
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2SphaKr>What the Best College Students Do</a>: This book was first introduced to me by Prof. Pankaj Jalote when I took his class at IIT Delhi in 2015. It was my dream to study at IIT Madras. However, when that did not happen, I started collecting years of notes on the qualities I missed. Surprisingly, this author lists every one of them! If only, I had read this during my school days.</li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2sZnzkH>What the Best College Teachers Do</a>: I am a teacher, at last! But, am I a good one? This time around, I have the right book with me. Many teachers have given up on the belief that teaching is important. Another key to successful teaching is the conviction that students can learn! We are here to bring a difference.</li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2tJ6Jak>Outliers</a>: The 10000 hour rule!! Majority of students under-achieve because of their divided attention. There is no single clear focus or goal. Having spent several 10K hours in life, had one of them been focused on a single thing, we would have been an expert by now! A great read for anyone.</li>
<li><a href=https://www.amazon.in/Intelligent-Investor-English-Paperback-2013/dp/0062312685/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=The+Intelligent+investor&qid=1578487212&sr=8-3&linkCode=ll1&tag=vvtesh-21&linkId=4222c17d968050b92d5ddd9882647f1d>The Intelligent Investor</a>: Wealth remains to be a prominant factor in our freedom to spend our time. This book shows that growing your wealth is simple! The best message is that you should start saving early. My ancestors tell me that first salary should go to Tirupati. I read this as a metaphor for saving your first pay intelligently and not touching it ideally forever. And, what if I tell you, this first pay of yours can compound and pay dividends that you can live freely when you retire!! Since I am a non-finance person, the reading was slow at many places. A book to be read and understood. Be an intelligent investor. </li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/35Y5UYE>Enid Blyton's Famous Five</a>: Many young students (and sometimes parents as well) tell me that they wish to improve their English. Moreover, many of them have never read any book, fiction or non-fiction. My suggestion to such people is to pick up the Famous Five series by Enid Blyton. I learnt English reading this series of books. What a simple jolly fun read! I still remember the days when mobile library van used to stop near my house. I run to be the first to reach the van and borrow this book. I had read almost all the books in this series before I reached class VII. It is a fun read. Highly recommended for any beginner. I should also note that my best research paper is named after my favorite character from this book, Anne! The paper is about "ANnotation Engine (Anne)".</li>
</ul>

<font face="verdana" size=2>Some great readings from the technical side:</font>
<ul>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2T6b2XO>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan</a>: Extremely well written! A very expensive book though. I was fortunate to get a used version of this book from US. I treasure it!</li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2sbo4Z0>Probability and Computing: Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Analysis</a>: I was first introduced to this book in a Randomized Algorithms course. Later, I found it to be the best text for probability, both introductory and advanced. If you are interested in probability, you should own this.</li>
<li><a href=https://amzn.to/2sZMlBB>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</a>: Another expensive, yet amazing book. I had the privilege of having lunch with Bishop, the author of this book. What a day!</li>
<li>For programmers and data scientists: <a href=https://amzn.to/2szfXFG>Introducing Data Science (through Python)</a>, <a href=https://amzn.to/2twps93>Design Patterns</a></li>
</ul>

<font face="verdana" size=2>When the best pen meets the best paper, ideas flow!</font>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/Parker-Odyssey-Brushed-Metal-Roller/dp/B00LM4OL4O/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=Pen+Parker&qid=1578487337&sr=8-27&linkCode=ll1&tag=vvtesh-21&linkId=f5e46e8d27aa545f0d39ba42145b5d91">Parker Odyssey Brushed Metal GT Roller Ball Pen, Gold Metal</a>: An awesome pen, a proud possession of a great writer! If I open my own college someday, this pen will be in the student's starter's kit gift.</li>
<li><a href=https://www.amazon.in/Luxor-Subject-Single-Ruled-Notebook/dp/B00LHZWD0C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=sati+70+gsm+notebook&qid=1578488422&sr=8-1-fkmr0&linkCode=ll1&tag=vvtesh-21&linkId=92af8e1f3b79863f903814454a5887d6>Luxor 5 Subject Single Ruled Notebook - A4, 70 GSM, 300 pages</a>: Another item for my students' kit. If you buy, do check for 70+ GSM before you buy. 80 GSM would be nicer but they are not easily available.</li>
</ul>
I too co-authored one book! See <a href="http://vvtesh.co.in/htmlbook/">HTML for Smart Kids</a>.
